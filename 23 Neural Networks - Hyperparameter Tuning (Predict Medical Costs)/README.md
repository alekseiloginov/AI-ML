Neural Networks - Hyperparameter Tuning (Predict Medical Costs)

The medical costs (insurance charges) dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance.

Goals:
- Build a neural network using TensorFlow with Keras to predict individual medical costs.
- Try manual and automated hyperparameter tuning for the model.
- Tune: learning rate, batch size, epochs.
- Try changing model's complexity, apply regularization (dropout), and compare predictions to a baseline.

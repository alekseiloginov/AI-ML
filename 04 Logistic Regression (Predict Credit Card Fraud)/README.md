Credit card transactions dataset is based on a synthetic financial dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1

`transactions.csv` is the original dataset containing 200k transactions.
`transactions_modified.csv` is a small portion of this dataset, which contains 1k transactions.

Goals:
- use Logistic Regression
- create a predictive model to determine if a transaction is fraudulent or not

Feature Selection - Wrapper Methods (Brest Cancer Prediction)

The breast cancer data is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/451/breast+cancer+coimbra

Goals:
- Implement and evaluate results for five different wrapper methods:
  - Sequential forward selection
  - Sequential backward selection
  - Sequential forward floating selection
  - Sequential backward floating selection
  - Recursive feature elimination

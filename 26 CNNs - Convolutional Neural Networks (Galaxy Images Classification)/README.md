CNNs - Convolutional Neural Networks (Galaxy Images Classification)

Image data is from Galaxy Zoo: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zookeeper/galaxy-zoo/.
The data falls into four classes:
- [1,0,0,0] - Galaxies with no identifying characteristics. Normal galaxies, which have a bright center, surrounded by a cloud of stars.
- [0,1,0,0] - Galaxies with rings. Ringed galaxies, which have a bright center, surrounded by a ring of stars.
- [0,0,1,0] - Galactic mergers. Galaxies, which contain two bright orbs surrounded by clouds, in the process of merging.
- [0,0,0,1] - "Other" - irregular celestial bodies. Irregular celestial objects with irregular clouds.

Goals:
- Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)) to classify deep-space galaxies.
- Visualize how the CNN processes images.

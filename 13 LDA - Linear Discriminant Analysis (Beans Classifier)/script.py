# LDA as a classifier

# We can also use LDA itself as a classifier.
# In this case, scikit-learn will project the data onto a subspace and then find a decision boundary that is perpendicular to that subspace.
# Put simply, it will do LDA and use the result to find a linear decision boundary.

# When using LDA as a classifier, itâ€™s not necessary to transform X into X_new.
# You can simply use the fit() method to fit lda to X and y.

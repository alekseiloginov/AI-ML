CNNs - Convolutional Neural Networks (X-rays Images Classification)

A dataset of X-ray lung scans of patients who had either pneumonia, Covid-19, or no illness is from Kaggle:

Goals:
- Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that outputs a diagnosis based on a patients' lungs X-ray scan.
- Plot model's accuracy changes for train and validation data over epochs.
- Evaluate false positives and false negatives by implementing a classification report and a confusion matrix.

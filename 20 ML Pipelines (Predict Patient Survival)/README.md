ML Pipelines (Predict Patient Survival)

A dataset containing bone marrow transplantation characteristics for pediatric patients is from UCI ML Repository.

Goals:
- Build a ML pipeline, containing data cleaning and preprocessing, feature selection, and classification steps.
- Perform numerical and categorical columns transformation using `ColumnTransformer`.
- Tune hyperparameters and select the best classifier to predict patient survival.

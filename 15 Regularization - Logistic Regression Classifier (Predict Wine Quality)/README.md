Regularization - Logistic Regression Classifier (Predict Wine Quality)

The red wine data is from the Wine Quality Dataset in the UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality.
The original dataset with a 1-10 rating for each wine, that is converted into a classification problem with a wine quality of good (>5 rating) or bad (<=5 rating).

Goals:
- Implement different logistic regression classifiers.
- Find the best ridge-regularized classifier using hyperparameter tuning. 
- Implement a tuned lasso-regularized feature selection method.

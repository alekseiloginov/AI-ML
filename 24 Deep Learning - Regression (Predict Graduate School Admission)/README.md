Deep Learning - Regression (Predict Graduate School Admission)

Graduate admissions dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions.

Goals:
- Use TensorFlow with Keras to create a deep learning regression model that predicts likelihood of a student admission to graduate school.
- Apply early stopping for efficiency.
- Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Average Error (MAE), and R-squared score.
- Plot the model's loss and mean average error per epoch for both training and validation data.

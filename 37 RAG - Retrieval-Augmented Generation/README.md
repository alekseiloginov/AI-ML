RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Monopoly Game Rules)

Dataset is represented by a PDF file describing the Monopoly game rules.

Goals:
- Ingest the PDF file into a Chroma vector database storing document embeddings.
- Apply RAG by pulling relevant context from our vector database and injecting it into the user prompt.

Deep Learning Classification (Predict Heart Failure Survival)

Heart Failure Prediction dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data.

Goals:
- Predict the survival of patients with heart failure considering multiple factors.
- Calculate cross-entropy and use it for classification.
- Prepare the data by encoding the labels and converting them to one-hot encoding format necessary for the loss function.
- Use softmax activation function for the output layer to perform classification.

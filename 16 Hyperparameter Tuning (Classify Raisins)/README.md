Hyperparameter Tuning (Classify Raisins)

The dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/raisin-dataset.
There are two raisin grain types in this dataset, Kecimen and Besni, 
and seven numerical predictor variables associated with each of the 900 samples in the data.

Goals:
- Classify different types of raisins.
- Implement two hyperparameter tuning methods: Grid Search and Random Search.
- Grid Search method to tune a Decision Tree Classifier.
- Random Search method to tune a Logistic Regression Classifier.

Bag-of-Words & Naive Bayes Classifier (Mystery Friend)

You’ve received an anonymous postcard from a friend who you haven’t seen in years. 
Your friend did not leave a name, but the card is definitely addressed to you. 

So far, you’ve narrowed your search down to three friends, based on handwriting:
- Emma Goldman
- Matthew Henson
- TingFang Wu

You have past writing from all three friends to help predict which friend sent you the card.

Goals:
- Use Bag-of-Words to vectorize the texts using the words frequency. 
- Use Naive Bayes classifier to determine who the mystery friend is based on similarity of the used words.

Decision Tree Classification (Find the flag)

The Flag dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Flags
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/flags/flag.data

Goals:
- use decision trees to predict the continent of flags based on several features (colors, shapes, etc)
- explore which features are the best to use to build a decision tree
- fine tune tree depth and CCP hyperparametes to get the best accuracy of the decision tree
- find and visualize feature importance calculated by DecisionTreeClassifier

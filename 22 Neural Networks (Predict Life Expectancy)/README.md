Neural Networks (Predict Life Expectancy)

The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository tracks life expectancy for countries 
worldwide. This dataset covers a variety of indicators for all countries from 2000 to 2015.

Goals:
- Predict life expectancy given all the factors.
- Design, train, and evaluate a neural network model performing a regression task of predicting life expectancy of the countries.

Ensemble Methods - Boosting - AdaBoost & Gradient Boosting (Income Prediction)

Dataset containing census information is from UCI ML Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/20/census+income.

Goals:
- By using boosting algorithms, predict whether or not a person makes more than $50,000.
- Prepare the features.
- Build and Train the AdaBoost and Gradient Boosted Trees Classifiers.
- Tune hyperparameters to determine the value that gives us the most performant model.

Deep Learning - Multi-Class Classification (Predict Forest Cover Type)

The actual forest cover type for a given 30 x 30 meter cell was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System data.
Independent variables were then derived from data obtained from the US Geological Survey and USFS.

The cover types are the following:
- Spruce/Fir
- Lodgepole Pine
- Ponderosa Pine
- Cottonwood/Willow
- Aspen
- Douglas-fir
- Krummholz

Goals:
- Build a deep learning model to predict the forest cover type from different cartographic variables.
- Develop a classifier for this multi-class classification problem.
- Test and analyze model performance over epochs (accuracy, loss plots).
- Summarize classification metrics (heatmap of confusion-matrix, classification report etc).

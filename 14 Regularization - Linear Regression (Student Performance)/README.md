Regularization - Linear Regression (Student Performance)

Student performance dataset is from UCI ML Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance.

Goals:
- Implement L1 and L2 Regularization with Linear Regression.
- Automate the Hyperparameter Search with GridsearchCV from `scikit-learn`.

Natural Language Processing - Word Embeddings (US Presidents Vocabulary)

Collection of inauguration speeches known as the US Presidential Inaugural Addresses is from the Natural Language Toolkit: 
https://www.nltk.org/book/ch02.html.

The files are named with the following convention: `YEAR-PRESIDENT.txt`
where YEAR is the year the inaugural address was given and PRESIDENT is the name of the president who gave the address. 
If there is only one president with a given last name, only the last name is used. 
For presidents with the same last name, first name and middle initial(s), separated by a -, are included.

Goals:
- Use word embeddings to analyze the inaugural addresses of the presidents of the United States.
- Train word embeddings on subsets of presidents VS all presidents to learn how presidents use language to convey their agenda.

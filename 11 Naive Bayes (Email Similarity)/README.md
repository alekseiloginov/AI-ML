Naive Bayes (Email Similarity)

Dataset of emails `20newsgroups` is from scikit-learn’s datasets. All the emails are tagged based on their content.

Goals:
- Use scikit-learn’s Naive Bayes implementation on several different datasets.
- By reporting the accuracy of the classifier, we can find which datasets are harder to distinguish.
